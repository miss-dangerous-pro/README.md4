# Ternary Operator in Python
In Python, the ternary operator is used to conditionally assign a value to a variable based on a condition. It's a shorthand for an if-else statement and allows you to write concise conditional expressions.

* Floor Division (//)
* Modulo (%)
* Division with divmod()

# Sequence operations
* In Python, sequence operators allow you to perform operations on sequence types like lists, tuples, strings, and ranges.

# Difference between == and is operator in Python
In Python, == and is are both used for comparison, but they have different purposes.
* Use == to compare if the values are the same.
* Use is to compare if the objects themselves are the same (i.e., if they occupy the same location in memory).
